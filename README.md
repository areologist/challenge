# challenge

Rough pass at the coding challenge.

### Overview

* React app for looking up addresses and seeing results in Map and/or List.
* Node app for reading the addresses file, indexing those addresses for basic text search, and geocoding the "ROOFTOP" addresses on demand and caching the results.
* Rate limiter on geocode requests per Google's cap.
* Communication between client and server over WebSocket so results can be presented asap.

## Full Stack Coding Challenge

#### Description
- Build a UI which will display a number of addresses retrieved from an api endpoint

#### Requirements
- Server
    - Geocode the items in the provided `addresses.csv` file by using the [Google Geocode API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding)
    - Add any necessary api endpoints that allow you to fulfill the requirements of the client
- Client
    - Only display items that result in a rooftop location type
    - Allow toggling between a list view and a map view of the results
    - Allow searching for a full/partial address in the results
        - `123 Rick Street` should return when searching for `Rick`

#### Submission Instructions
- Clone this repository and commit your changes locally (or to a separate remote repository)
- You're free to use any packages or libraries which help you to complete these tasks
- We should be able to start the application by doing a `npm install` and `npm start` on both the client and server (we will be running the code and QA will also be looking at the final product)
- When you are finished, please send us a link to the completed repository or a zip of the contents if you prefer

#### Criteria
- Must fulfill all requirements completely
- Our tech stack includes React and Node, so that is our preference but not required
- Keep in mind best practices, screen resolution and future considerations
- Describe any challenges that made the task more difficult
